# Loan-Default-Prediction
Introduction 


This research project centers around the development of a sophisticated 
machine learning model dedicated to the task of loan default prediction. By 
leveraging a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse applicant features such 
as age, income, credit score, and employment details, the model aims to discern 
intricate patterns indicative of potential defaults. Through meticulous data 
exploration, advanced feature engineering techniques, and the implementation of 
ensemble learning methodologies, we endeavor to optimize the model's 
predictive performance and enhance its interpretability.
